# The FISHY data

We are analyzing data from an experiment in which larval stickleback fish from two populations (Boot Lake “Bt” and Rabbit Slough “RS”) is exposed to one of two treatments: a conventional microbiota (“CV”) or germ-free (“GF”). RNA was isolated from the intestinal tracts of the experimental fish and used to make individual TruSeq mRNA-seq libraries. 

We are interested in genes differentially expressed between fish of different populations and genes differentially expressed between fish exposed or unexposed to microbes.
